# Face Detection and Recognition with YOLOv8 and FaceNet-PyTorch  

This project implements a robust face detection and recognition pipeline using YOLOv8 for face-keypoint detection and the FaceNet-PyTorch library for face recognition. The system identifies individuals in a video using pre-recorded images in a database. Additionally, it uses a buffer mechanism to improve recognition accuracy by voting across consecutive frames.

## Overview  
This repository demonstrates a system for detecting and recognizing faces from video footage. The project includes:  
- **Face Detection**: Using YOLOv8 with face-keypoint pretrained weights to detect facial landmarks.  
- **Face Recognition**: Using FaceNet-PyTorch and InceptionResNetV1 with VGGFace2 pretrained weights to extract face embeddings and match identities.  
- **Buffer Mechanism**: Reduces misidentifications by voting across consecutive frames of the same detected face.  

The repository provides a sample dataset and an 8-second CCTV video of two individuals visiting a subway wagon for demonstration purposes.

## Features  
- Detects faces and tracks their motion using YOLOv8 with face-keypoint pretrained weights.  
- Extracts facial embeddings with FaceNet-PyTorch using VGGFace2 pretrained weights.  
- Recognizes individuals by comparing embeddings against a database using cosine similarity.  
- Implements a buffer mechanism to improve recognition accuracy.  
- Includes a ready-to-use notebook for step-by-step execution.

## Pipeline Details  

### Face Detection with YOLOv8  
- Utilizes YOLOv8 with face-keypoint pretrained weights.  
- Detects five keypoints per face: both eyes, nose, and two edges of the lips.  
- Tracks faces across video frames.  

### Face Recognition with FaceNet-PyTorch  
- Uses InceptionResNetV1 with VGGFace2 pretrained weights.  
- Extracts 512-dimensional embedding vectors for detected faces.  
- Matches embeddings with a prebuilt database using cosine similarity:  

  **Cosine Similarity Formula**:  

$\text{Similarity} = \frac{\text{Embedding}_1 \cdot \text{Embedding}_2}{\|\text{Embedding}_1\| \|\text{Embedding}_2\|}$


### Buffer Mechanism for Robust Recognition  
- Buffers consecutive frames of a detected face ID.  
- Votes across `n` frames to assign the final identity.  
- Reduces misidentifications and improves accuracy.

## Demo  
The repository includes:  
- A **video**: CCTV footage of two individuals (8 seconds).  
- A **database**: Contains images of Kathy Hochul (4 images) and Janno Lieber (2 images).  
- The Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step instructions.
